Data Wrangling and Analysis of WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

----
WeRateDogs Enhanced Twitter archive contains data extracted from 2356 of the 5000+ tweets posted between 15th of November 2015 and 1st of August 2017 from the [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) twitter account archive. 
In this project, I wrangled the data by first gathering the data from 3 different sources, then assessing and cleaning it. I also analysed it to generate some insights and visualization.
